Once upon a time there were three cousins.
Their names were Allison, Lilian, and ${third name}.
They loved to play together and do crazy things!
One day they were sitting on the porch and a weird man with a camera came and wanted to take their picture.
Of course they said yes, because they were extremely brave.
After that, they explored a haunted sanitarium and hospital.
They were great friends and they loved to hang out with each other.
Finally, it was time to say goodbye. There were many tears and hugs all around.
"Goodbye cousin, until next time", they agreed.
