###Creating a root key###

Run the following commands to generate a root certificate and key you'll use to sign the device keys:

$ openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem

This certificate (stored in rootCA.pem) can be imported as a trusted CA on devices you own
so that certificates signed with the key (rootCA.key) will be implicitly trusted.

The key should be kept secret; if it is leaked then third parties could begin to
generate certificates that would be trusted by your devices.


###Generating new certificate:###

From a directory containing the root key and certificate (rootCA.key and rootCA.pem)
run the following commands:

$ keytool -genkey -alias discoveryroom -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore -keysize 2048
-- The "first and last name" should be the hostname or IP of the server, or the domain name if applicable
-- The other fields are less important
-- Feel free to use the same password for the keystore and the key

$ keytool -certreq -alias discoveryroom -keystore keystore -file mydomain.csr
$ openssl x509 -req -in mydomain.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out mydomain.crt -days 500
$ keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias root -file rootCA.pem -keystore keystore
$ keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias discoveryroom -file mydomain.crt -keystore keystore

Once the keystore is generated, you need to copy it to your service host and change the
password hashes in the properties file
